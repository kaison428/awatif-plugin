## Awatif Engine

Source: `scripts/engine.ts`, built on awatif's `createStates` and `runAnalysis`.
Run it on a model with `scripts/analyze.mjs` (see SKILL.md); import `createEngine`
directly only for studies the runner does not cover (parameter sweeps, nonlinear).
The engine is headless. The interactive app for the user is `scripts/serve.mjs`,
which mounts the same model with `createApp`; both run the same pipeline.

```ts
// The state and analysis pipeline of an app, without any UI: change an input
// and the pipeline re-runs, then subscribers receive the new results.
//
// Positions are in meters and forces are in Kilo-Newton, everything else
// propagates from these two assumptions.
export async function createEngine(config: AppConfig = {}): Promise<Engine>

export type Engine = {
  // Snapshot of the latest run
  getAll(): Results;
  // Called after every completed run; returns the unsubscribe function
  subscribe(callback: (results: Results) => void): () => void;
  // Resolves with the results of the next completed run
  next(): Promise<Results>;

  // Each of these changes state, which re-runs the pipeline
  setModel(model: Model): void;
  setParams(componentName: string, params: Record<string, unknown>): void;
  setAnalysis(analysis: "linear" | "nonlinear"): void;
  // A load case or load combination by name; `null` applies every load
  setActiveLoad(name: string | null): void;

  // The live states behind the results, for anything the API does not cover
  states: {
    geometry: Geometry;
    components: Components;
    mesh: Mesh;
    display: Display;
    analysisStatus: AnalysisStatus;
    activeAnalysis: State<"linear" | "nonlinear">;
  };
  loadCaseIds: LoadCaseIds;
  templates: ComponentTemplates;
};

export type Results = {
  status: { success: boolean; error?: string; unassignedLines?: number[]; iterations?: number };
  analysis: "linear" | "nonlinear";
  activeLoad: string | null; // load case or combination name of the run
  nodes: number[][]; // mesh nodes [x, y, z]
  elements: number[][]; // mesh elements [node, node]
  geometryMapping: { pointToNodes; lineToElements; polygonToElements }; // Map<id, index[]>
  displacements: number[]; // [u1x, u1y, u1z, u2x, ...] per node, m
  reactions: [Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz][]; // per node, kN / kNm
  internalForces: Map<element, InternalForces>; // see data-model.md §7
  designs: Map<lineId, Design>; // design template output per line
};
```

Notes:

- The first run uses the first load case. Results are for one load case or combination at a time; set each with `setActiveLoad` and `await next()`.
- Call `next()` before the setter so the run is not missed: `const r = engine.next(); engine.setActiveLoad("ULS-1"); await r;`
- Reactions oppose the applied loads: their sum is equal and opposite to the total load.
- `nonlinear` runs on a hosted solver and needs network access.

## `scripts/analyze.mjs` output (`results.json`)

```ts
{
  model: string;
  runs: {
    load: string | null;
    analysis: "linear" | "nonlinear";
    status: Results["status"];
    maxDisplacement: { position: [x, y, z] | null; u; ux; uy; uz }; // over all mesh nodes, m
    reactions: { point; Fx; Fy; Fz; Mx; My; Mz }[]; // supported points only
    displacements: { point; ux; uy; uz }[]; // every authored point, m
    lines: { line; N; Vy; Vz; Mx; My; Mz: { min; max } }[]; // envelopes along each line
    designs: { line; ...Design }[];
  }[];
}
```

Points and lines use the model's own ids. The script exits with code 1 if any run failed.
